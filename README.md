The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made available by Apple.

The data isn't available anymore. Apple stopped releasing the data 04/12/2022.

### Change Log

* 2022-09-02: data subsetted for Ohio.

* 22-09-27: I worked to refactor the code to be able to subset any state from the larger file.
